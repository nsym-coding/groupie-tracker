# groupie-tracker

# Groupie Trackers consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.

We were given an API, that consists in four parts:

The first one was, artists, containing information about some bands and artists like their name(s), image, in which year they began their activity, the date of their first album and the members.

The second one was, locations, consisting of their last and/or upcoming concert locations.

The third one, dates, consisted of their last and/or upcoming concert dates.

And the last one, relation, does the link between all the other parts, artists, dates and locations.

Given all this we had to build a user friendly website where you can display the bands info through several data visualizations (examples : blocks, cards, tables, list, pages, graphics, etc). It is up to you to decide how you will display it.

This project also focuses on the creation of events/actions and on their visualization.

The event/action we needed to implement was a client call to the server (client-server). 

It had to be a feature of our choice that needed to trigger an action. This action must communicate with the server in order to recieve information.

An event consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.

# Instructions
The backend must be written in Go.
The site and server cannot crash at any time.
All pages must work correctly and you must take care of any errors.
